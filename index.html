        McFadden was born in Clonseagh Dublin, Ireland, and was raised
        Catholic.[1] Throughout his younger years, he always had an interest in
        singing, dancing and football.[2] Along with his sister Susan, McFadden
        attended the Billie Barry Stage School in Dublin,[2] which led him to
        doing stage and TV roles, including a role in the Irish TV show Finbar's
        Class, a comedy revolving around a group of student-swingers.[3] In
        early 1998, he formed a pop-R&B group with his friends Tim and Darragh,
        called Cartel, and performed live gigs in Dublin pubs.[2] When the band
        passed their credentials to prominent Irish music manager Louis Walsh,
        McFadden was asked to come to the audition for the formation of a new
        band that would later be called Westlife.
